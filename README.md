<details><summary>Arrays and Strings</summary>
  <li>hasAllUniqueChars - determines whether a String repeats any characters - O(N)</li>
  <li>isPermutation - determines whether one String could be rearranged into another given String - O(N)</li>
  <li>urlify - replaces spaces in a character array with the characters '%', '2', and '0' - O(N)</li>
  <li>isPalindromePermutation - determines whether a String can be rearranged into a pallindrome - O(N)</li>
  <li>compress - removes any repeated characters and replaces them with a count of that character - O(N)</li>
  <li>isOneEditAway - determines whether one String has had a single character addition, subtraction or modification from as compared to another String - O(N)</li>
  <li>rotate90 - given a square matrix of integers, rotates values in place so the matrix appears shifted 90 degrees O(N<sup>2</sup>)</li>
